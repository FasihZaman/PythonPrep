Interview prep for Software Engineering positions 


#### Hello World, 
I am a data nerd who loves consuming data and information to make data-driven decisions. With a background in Computer Engineering, I have worked across a spectrum of technologies such as Machine Learning, Operating Systems, System Programming, Data Analytics, Web Engineering, and Quantitative Scientific Analysis. 

I want to get a job at a Medium-Sized Tech Company in Nothern America or Europe. I am holding myself accountable with this Repo to solve HackerRank questions and improve with time as a developer. I'll be uploading my answers daily for the next three to six months. I aim to land a job by practicing these questions and getting better. 

Wish me luck.
Love, 
Fasih
